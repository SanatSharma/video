# video
Some tests with video.js

# How to run

In a directory, open a command prompt and type
 ``` 
  git clone https://github.com/SanatSharma/video.git
 ```
 Now go into the newly cloned repo
 ```
  cd video
 ```
 We need to now install the dependency packages. However, first you must install npm. npm is now packaged with node, so download
 that from https://nodejs.org/en/
 Now that you have node and npm installed, install the packages
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 Now you should be able to run test.html in a web browser
